# Roommate Management App

A cross-platform mobile application designed to make shared living simpler and more transparent. Roommate Management App brings together chore tracking, expense splitting, shared inventory, and timely reminders in one unified experience.

## What It Does

- **Chore Coordination**  
  Assign one-time or recurring chores to household members, visualize a weekly grid with status indicators (complete, incomplete, upcoming), and tap into a detailed view of each person’s chores and due dates.

- **Expense Splitting & Payments**  
  Log group expenses with equal or custom splits, see a running history of who owes what, and record peer-to-peer repayments—all while keeping real-time balance summaries for every user.

- **Shared Inventory**  
  Keep track of communal items (kitchen supplies, toiletries, tools, etc.) by category. Expand or collapse each section to view items, their quantities, owners, and notes.

- **Smart Notifications**  
  Never miss a due chore or payment with both local scheduled reminders and remote push notifications via Expo. Handle notifications in-app or deep-link users directly to the relevant screen.

- **Unified Dashboard**  
  Glance at your next chore, upcoming calendar events, current balances, and inventory highlights from a single home screen

## Why It Matters

Living with roommates can get complicated—overlapping schedules, chore confusion, split bills, and shared supplies. This app centralizes all of that:

- **Transparency:** Everyone sees the same chore grid, expense ledger, and inventory lists.  
- **Accountability:** Automated reminders and payment flows reduce missed tasks and forgotten bills.  
- **Convenience:** One click to add chores, log expenses, or pop up an inventory modal—no more group chats or whiteboard scribbles.

With Roommate Management App, co-living becomes a little less chaotic and a lot more collaborative.
